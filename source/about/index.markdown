NiFi.rocks is a place to understand and learn about the new [Apache NiFi](http://nifi.incubator.apache.org/).  Apache NiFi is a framework built around the [flow based programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) (FBP) paradigm.  

If you aren't familiar with FBP, it is a programming concept of a set of processes that exchange data over predefined paths to achieve a larger goal in an application.  Flow based programming allows for modularization of the code beyond interfaces and allows processing units to be reused and reassembled to achieve whatever goal you have in mind.  It is a pretty cool idea and tak
es code reausability to a new level.

Apache Nifi is currently in incubation and was just recently accepted into the Apache Software Foundation.  This means the project is going through alot of changes and will be adding additional funcionality with each release.  We hope to follow it's progess and deliver tutorials and how-to's, both written and through screen casts, to help those interested take advantage of Apache NiFi.
