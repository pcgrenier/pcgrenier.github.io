Apache Nifi release 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 recently and I wanted to go throught and highlight some of the key changes that may affect you Nifi users.  So far Nifi has kept pretty well to thier 6 week release schedule that they have discussed.  That's a really agressive release schedule so we'll see if they can keep that up once they hit the 0.7.0/1.0.0 release, which they say is going to actually be pushed back a little.  The 0.6.0 release was again substantial with 52 bug fixes, 15 improvements and 7 new features.  0.6.1 didn't take to long to follow with 11 bug fixes and 1 improvement.  The release binaries are on the [Apache Nifi download page](https://nifi.apache.org/download.html)The full release notes are avaialble on [Apaches Nifi's wiki page](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/Release+Notes#ReleaseNotes-Version0.6.1).  The combined 0.6.* release information is below.

* [Bug Fixes](#bugfixes): 			63
